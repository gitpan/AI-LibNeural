AI::LibNeural version 0.02
==========================

This module provides access to the c++ library libneural.
(http://ieee.uow.edu.au/~daniel/software/libneural/ or search for libneural on
freshmeat.net.) libneural is a simple, but useful, backpropagation neural
network. It isn't packed with features or a speed demon, but it works and it's
easy to learn how to use.

INSTALLATION

> perl Makefile.PL
or 
> perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/some/non/system/place
(then setting PERL5LIB as appropriate based on ^ is a good ideal)
ignore the warnings about CC and LD being unknown parameters, then
> make all test install

Provided that everything goes well this should build the module, test it out,
and install it. If you encounter problems try e-mailing the author with as
much detail as possible. System type, os version, perl version, libneural
version, cpp compiler, script of the failing Makefile creation and compile
process.

USE

For information on using this library see the POD within AI::LibNeural.pm by
typing 'perldoc LibNeural.pm' in the same directory as this README or by
typing 'perldoc AI::LibNeural' after installtion.

DEPENDENCIES

libneural v1.0.3 or newer (it may work with older versions, but they have not
been tested.)
